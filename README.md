# SmartOrder ‚Äì Advanced E-Commerce Microservices System

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Goal

This project is designed as a **production-grade microservices system** built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **modern cloud-native technologies**. Its primary goal is to serve as a **learning and practice platform** to explore and master real-world architectures, tools, and patterns used in high-scale distributed systems.
